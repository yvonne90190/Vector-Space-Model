# ****Modification and Analysis of IR Models in Indri****  
* Modified algorithms of four retrieval models (TF-IDF, BM25, Language Models...) in Indri, running on a set of 50 TREC queries against WT2G collection. 
* Compare the models, smoothing techniques, and stemming effects according to the evaluation results (MAP, Recall-Precision, R-precision)

The detail description and data analysis is in **_WSM_Project2.pdf_**
